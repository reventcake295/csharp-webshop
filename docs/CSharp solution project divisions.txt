.NET solution projects dividers

Central processing:
	.Common: Common models
			Contains the common models for usage by the other projects in the solution
	.Server: class Library Project that contains implementations of interfaces that are meant to be used by the Server Applications
		.Data: Database Framework (ORM)
				Deals with the handling of the database for the rest of the solution and allows for the conversion of the model type between entity and common and vice versa
		.Service: Service
				Handles the external interfaces of the Solution and allows them to access the Central processes required
		.Run: Runnables
				Handles the actions needed for the Solution but are not specific to one External interface and does not deal with one of the other central processes
	
	.Client: class Library Proejct that contains implementations of interfaces that are meant to be used by the Client Applications, also may contain a connector to the Server API for usage witht he server using endpoint /client
	
External interfaces:
	.SCli: Server CLI interface
			Handles the CLI Interface and allows the CLI to interact with the Central processes as needed
			Dependency: Common, Server, Data, Service, Run
	.Web: Server Web app (Razor pages / MVC)
			Handles the website and such and all interactions required, the client js may also use the Server API endpoint /web for interactive funcionality
			Dependency: Common, Server, Data, Service, Run
			
	.Api: Server API (OpenAPI)
			Handles any API requests that come in and gives the data required as needed and allowed from the Central processes
			Dependency: Common, Server, Data, Service, Run
			General endpoint groups:
				/public
				/secure
				/client
				/web
			
	.CCli: Client User Cli interface
